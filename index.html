            <p>
                Hello! I am a biracial actress, native Japanese speaker, musician, dancer, and scientist. I graduated
                with a B.S. in neuroscience from Tufts University - what?! I know, I know, here's the short version:
                Growing up, my studies lead me to Japan, France, India, Argentina, and South Africa. By living with
                local families in these countries I had the privilage of seeing the world through each unique
                community's lens - to see how food customs, healthcare, and culture are all interwoven.
                Through these experiences, I was introduced to the power of storytelling and its significance in every
                human's life and the impact it can have on people. I thus realized I had to pursue my dream of acting!
                My goal is to weave together my passion for global health and science with this creative art of
                storytelling. Wish me luck!
            </p>
